## Project Overview
This project is a simple PHP-based application designed.

### Key Features
- Use PHP 7.4.33 (cli)
- No frameworks used, pure PHP implementation for clean architecture.
- Manual unit tests for all classes (not use PHPUnit).

### How to Run
1. Ensure Composer is installed and run `composer dump-autoload` to set up PSR-4 autoloading.
2. Execute the main script: `php index.php` to see a sample order calculation.
3. Run tests individually: `php tests/<TestFile>.php` (e.g., `php tests/Services/OrderServiceTest.php`).

## Future Development
If more time is available, the following feature could be added later:  
- **Validation**: Add checks to ensure data (like product dimensions, weight, and quantities) is valid and reasonable.
